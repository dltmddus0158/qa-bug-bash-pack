# Regression Checklist (Web)

## Smoke
- [ ] Page loads without major layout break
- [ ] Core navigation works

## Critical Flows
- [ ] Search works
- [ ] Form submit/validation works
- [ ] Key buttons/links respond

## Accessibility Quick Check
- [ ] Visible focus
- [ ] Keyboard navigation through main flow
- [ ] Headings make sense

## Automation Considerations (Future)

The following scenarios are good candidates for automation:
- Smoke checks for global navigation availability
- Search submission with valid inputs
- Keyboard focus visibility regression checks

More exploratory and usability-focused scenarios are intentionally kept manual.
